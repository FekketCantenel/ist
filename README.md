# [ist](https://ist.never-ends.net/)

Ist is a small tool that reads your [Todoist](https://todoist.com/r/fiona_van_dahl_mwutdy) projects and tasks, then spits out the task you should work on <em>right now</em> &mdash; the highest-priority, in your current context, that's due today.</em>

## Setup

Start by [signing up for Todoist](https://todoist.com/r/fiona_van_dahl_mwutdy). (Ist works fine without [Todoist Premium](https://todoist.com/premium), but I recommend it, especially to unlock task comments.)</p>

Create 'projects' that correspond to the [contexts](https://gettingthingsdone.com/2010/09/david-allen-on-why-sorting-your-lists-by-contexts-even-matters) you work with (e.g. "routine", "home", "errands", "online"). You can always change these later. The first project in your list (drag-and-drop) should always be 'routine'/'personal'/'self-care' tasks; these will override tasks from other projects. Exclude projects using a trailing underscore, e.g. "Project\_".

Now add tasks to these contexts, each with a priority and due date (and repeat rule if needed). You can also use [Markdown formatting](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown/wiki/Showdown's-Markdown-syntax), emojis, and comments<sup>Todoist Premium</sup>.

When ready, click the button at the bottom of Ist to authorize it to access your Todoist account.
